# Google-Books-C18
University of Richmond Bootcamp - Code Challenge 18 - Google Books API
Created By: Brad Webster in collaboration with edX Coding Bootcamp
## Description:
Google Books Search and Save is a web application designed to streamline the process of discovering and managing books for avid readers and researchers alike. In today's digital age, where information is abundant but time is scarce, this application serves as a bridge between the vast Google Books database and a user's personal reading list.

The motivation behind this project was to create a tool that not only allows users to search for books efficiently but also provides a way to curate a personal library of saved books for future reference.

This application addresses this issue by allowing users to search for books using the Google Books API, view detailed information about each book, and save their favorites to a personal list. By combining the power of the Google Books database with personalized user accounts, the app creates a seamless experience for book discovery and management.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and incorporating GraphQL + Apollo, this project showcases my skills in full-stack development and modern web technologies. It demonstrates the implementation of user authentication, third-party API integration, and database management in a real-world application context.

Through building this application, I deepened my understanding of MongoDB for data persistence, GraphQL for efficient data querying, and Apollo for proxy test environments. This project not only serves as a useful tool for book lovers but also represents a significant milestone in my journey as a web developer.
